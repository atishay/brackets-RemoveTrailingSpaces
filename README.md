Remove Trailing Whitespace
=================

Adobe Brackets: https://github.com/adobe/brackets

A Brackets extension to remove all trailing white spaces in the document on save.
When installed, you can enable clicking 'X Trailing Whitespace' in your View menu.

Install
========
Open Brackets and click Help > Show Extensions Folder
Clone the extension into the user subdirectory:

    git clone git://github.com/atishay811/brackets-RemoveTrailingSpaces.git user/RemoveTrailingSpaces

There is also support for removing the menu item(I also hate the menu clutter). If you do need an always on version with no menu item, open *main.js* and change the last line to:

    load(true)
